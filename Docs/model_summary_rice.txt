Model: Linear Regression
Target: RICE PRODUCTION (1000 tons)
Features: RICE AREA (1000 ha), RICE YIELD (Kg per ha), Year
R²: 0.816

Predicted (1000 tons): 1195.23

Interpretation:
Higher area and yield → higher predicted production.
R² close to 1 is better; MAE is average error in '1000 tons'.
